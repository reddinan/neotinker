A plugin to access Laravel's tinker feature from the command line.

This was a for fun project to learn more about Neovim. It works for me but there is almost certainly a better way to do this. 

To install simply add the file to your plugins directory. 

To access tinker press <leader>5

To close tinker press <leader>5

Note: This plugin was developed using the lazyvim distro so it's possible that something I did here is specific to that environment.
